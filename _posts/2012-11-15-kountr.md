In 2012, EveryScape specialized in the creation of panoramic content to be used as advertising and marketing material for small businesses all over the world. In working with advertisers on how best to use social media, we had the insight that the metrics provided by networks like Facebook can tell advertisers a lot about what happened, but not a lot about what they should be doing to improve their results. This is especially true in the small business market, where advertisers  have to be relevant to their local market, and usually donâ€™t care about a scaled national or international presence.

Kountr was created as a tool to let advertisers see a timeline of posts of only themselves and their perceived competition, with a score for each post based on the engagement it generated. This allowed advertisers to learn by example from among their market peers, and at the same time, keep tabs on the competition.

My role with Kountr was threefold: participate in the overall product design from the perspective of understanding what was possible given the technical constraints, conceiving of and refining the algorithms to determine the relative score of particular social media posts, and implementing the whole thing, including deep integration with the APIs of social media sites.
