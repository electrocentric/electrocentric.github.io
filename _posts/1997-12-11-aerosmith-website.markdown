The first dedicated Internet presence for the world-famous rock band Aerosmith stretched the limits of browser technology at the time.

I had a few different roles over the years, including at one point being the sole systems administrator for the site. For the initial launch, my job was to create several pages that had dynamic content, including one that included a section titled “This Day in Aerosmith History”. The dynamic text underneath that heading was pulled from a curated database of important events from throughout the history of the band.
