The Ultimate Band List (ubl.com) was brought to Nimbit as a popular site among musicians and fans for its ambitious collection of information, but was hobbled by an emphasis on major label artists at a time when the consumer market was trending toward Indie bands. The challenge was to preserve the utility while refocusing the site on the new target market of independent musicians and their fans, and creating a means of monetizing the property within those constraints.

Among the many aspects of this project that I worked on, I designed and implemented a novel content-aware cache system that allowed the site to run at a much higher capacity while responding in real-time to changes in underlying data.
