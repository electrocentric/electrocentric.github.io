BuyItOnline.com (the company, and the domain name) was purchased by Stumpworld Systems in 1998, and in 1999 the brand was relaunched as an online shopping mall that aggregated many of the storefronts created with the OnlineMerchant software.

I was responsible for the specification, configuration, and installation of the production hardware for the relaunch in a colocation facility. The required everything from setting up and optimizing a small Oracle cluster on Solaris, to doing the same for the IIS web servers on Windows, to physically altering the equipment rack to make everything fit.
