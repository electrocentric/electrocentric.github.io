The American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) engaged Nimbit for a partnership where the tools and web hosting products that had been developed for use by Nimbit’s customers could be made available to ASCAP members at a reduced cost through a co-branded product called ASCAP Web Tools (www.ascapwebtools.com).

To be honest, this was a fairly straightforward, if time-consuming, exercise in re-branding the software that we had already written. I include it here mostly as a milestone of validation, where a major organization in the music industry elected to brand our product as its own.
