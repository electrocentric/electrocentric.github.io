The Nimbit Web Tools were a suite of tools added to a website by including an embed code, the content of which could be managed remotely using an editor interface on nimbit.com. This was before CMS software became prevalent, and served a broader strategy of using technology to lower the barriers between what independent musicians could achieve on their own versus the support that a record label would offer.

I was brought on to both help flesh out the tools, and add my IT expertise to the problem of managing the web hosting of the companyâ€™s growing user base. Handling those web hosting needs would eventually require building out server clusters in two different remote data centers, and creating processes and software to safeguard those clusters and keep them running optimally.
