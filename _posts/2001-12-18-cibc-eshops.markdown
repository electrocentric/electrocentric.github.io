CIBC (The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce) engaged us to create a white-labeled version of BuyItOnline.com called CIBC eShops (www.cibceshops.ca), which they offered for free to their commercial banking customers. This project required an intensive security design, implementation and acceptance process that ultimately resulted in a dedicated communication channel between the Surefire Commerce primary data center, and the CIBC primary data center.

My work in this project began with the design for a secure server-to-server messaging protocol, using a signed envelope around an XML document. The implementation of a version of this protocol became the standard for the dedicated communication channel noted above. Additionally, I was the sole onsite representative for Surefire at CIBCâ€™s data center during most of the six-week testing and integration process.
