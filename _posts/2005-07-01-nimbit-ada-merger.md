In 2004, Nimbit merged with Artist Development Associates, and the process of combining services, technologies (and offices) began. When the integration was completed, in the summer of 2005, the combined services of the two former partners became available in a seamless unified platform.

A large part of my role during this period was in reorganizing the IT fulfillment to meet the needs of the merged companies, helping to migrate ADA’s retail property “CDFreedom.com” from ASP to PHP, and further extensions of Nimbit’s web tools and hosting products.
