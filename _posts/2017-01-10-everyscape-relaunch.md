The beginning of 2017 saw the culmination of years of work, with a launch of a free, direct to consumer iOS app that allowed capture, edit, and data enhancement of 360° content, as well as the ability to experience that content together with other people in real time. A full re-branding of the entire company accompanied this product launch.

As the person in charge of all of the software development and IT functions, I fulfilled many roles on the way toward this milestone. More specifically, I oversaw the creation of the entire system, shepherded the team through many complex technical challenges, and was a strong influencer within the design and execution phases of the corporate re-branding process.

As an individual contributor, I built a ground-up implementation of a notifications system using an API of my own design, and finished the implementation of much of the accompanying marketing collateral.
