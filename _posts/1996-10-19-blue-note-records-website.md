The original website for Blue Note Records, a legendary record label known for publishing and distributing the works of world class blues and jazz artists.

To my recollection, the Blue Note site was only the 2nd website I had worked on professionally, and it’s still one that’s close to my heart because I just love the music.

If you’re curious, the first site that I worked on professionally was a simple shopping cart for guitar legend Eric Johnson, but that page (it wasn’t even a full site) has been lost to history.
