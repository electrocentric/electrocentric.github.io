EveryScape has partnerships with multiple companies for whom some or all of the products are white-labelled for those companiesâ€™ use, which is typically exists as a reseller arrangement. The majority of the day to day work at EveryScape is in maintaining and fulfilling these relationships.

In June of 2014 one of these efforts was migrating a partner to a transactional API for order entry, rather than the daily batch process that had existed prior. Sensitivity on turn around times for production were a major driving force for the change. Now, the partner can see in near real-time the status of an order, and EveryScape is able to start working on an order almost immediately after the deal is signed in the field.

My responsibilities with this project started with the initial design of the API, carried through with a major reworking to the specification based on feedback from the partner, and being the in-house owner of the specification through its implementation. Additionally, I was responsible for implementing the authentication layer of the API, based on a scheme already in use by the partner.
