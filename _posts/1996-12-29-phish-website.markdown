The first Internet presence for the venerable jam band, Phish. In addition to the marketing and tour information aspects, this site also launched with its own online store, which was very innovative at that time.

For Phish, I was responsible for producing the shopping cart software inside their “Dry Goods” store, including the development of a secure credit card retrieval system (online transactions weren’t really a thing yet).
