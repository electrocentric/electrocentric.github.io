Iterating on the idea of intersecting imagery of places with collaboration, a new product, Smarter Listings, was developed to target the commercial real estate market. In addition to developing workflows that integrate with existing customer processes, we also expanded the scope of the content types that would work on the platform - enabling customers to use the photography they already have, or leverage the content fulfillment channels that they already use.

In order to accomplish this, the entire application had to be rearchitected as compared to the platform we had launched in 2017. My primary role was to design the application architecture to handle the new content requirements, as well as apply lessons learned from the 2017 product with regard to performance and scaling.
