By 2010, the Nimbit platform had expanded to include downloadable music, ticketing products, customizable storefront widgets, storefronts on Facebook and MySpace pages, support for pre-sales and product bundling. The product offering stood head and shoulders above its competition.

I was one of a very small team of contributors that implemented the whole platform, with my particular focus being on maintaining and extending integrations with outside systems, including payment gateways, logistics providers, and sales and marketing services.
