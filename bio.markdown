I was a city boy for most of my adult life, but now my amazing partner and I live in the burbs with a house full of pets, including those of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat" alt="(cat)">feline</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog" alt="(dog)">canine</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse" alt="(horse)">equine</a> persuasions. We used to keep chickens, and possibly will again, but so far I've managed to avoid owning any goats.

My first MMORPG was <a alt="InfinityMUD" href="http://www.infinitymud.com/" target="_blank">text-based</a>, and I can still remember how to set up IPX links for LAN parties in the Doom era. These days I mostly keep it to casual play of open world games, but I can usually still hold my own in first-person shooters and driving games when given the opportunity.

I also embody some stereotypes about the affinity of Internet nerds for things like Star Warsâ„¢ and avoiding direct sunlight. The latter I can blame on genetics, but the former I own completely.

When I do have enough sunscreen, I love being in the woods. Given my druthers, I would probably live in a tree house, but short of hiring <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nelsontreehouseandsupply.com/" alt="Nelson Treehouse">these people</a>, there are some practical issues with that plan.

Beyond that, I spend a lot of my <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/8JtnEUPvpus" alt="Video of Foghorn Leghorn indicating that it's a joke.">copious leisure time</a> shooting <a href="/photography" alt="Photo gallery">photos</a> of things that strike my fancy. You can find some of those scattered around this site, and elsewhere.
